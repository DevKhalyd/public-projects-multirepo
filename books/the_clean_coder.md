## Whe say no

Professionals speak truth to power. Professionals have the courage to say no to
their managers.

How do you say no to your boss? After all, it’s your boss! Aren’t you supposed to
do what your boss says?

No. Not if you are a professional.

Slaves are not allowed to say no. Laborers may be hesitant to say no. But
professionals are expected to say no. Indeed, good managers crave someone who
has the guts to say no. It’s the only way you can really get anything done.

## Depending on x's work

**It wouldn’t work because I rely on person X to get this done.**

You can only commit to things that you have full control of. For example, if
your goal is to finish a module that also depends on another team, you can’t
commit to finish the module with full integration with the other team. But
you can commit to specific actions that will bring you to your target. You
could:

• Sit down for an hour with Gary from the infrastructure team to understand
your dependencies.

• Create an interface that abstracts your module’s dependency from the other
team's infrastructure.

• Meet at least three times this week with the build guy to make sure your
changes work well in the company’s build system.

• Create your own personal build that runs your integration tests for the
module.

**See the difference?**

If the end goal depends on someone else, you should commit to specific actions
that bring you closer to the end goal.

It wouldn’t work because I don’t really know if it can be done.
If it can’t be done, you can still commit to actions that will bring you closer
to the target. Finding out if it can be done can be one of the actions to
commit to!

Instead of committing to fix all 25 remaining bugs before the release (which
may not be possible), you can commit to these specific actions that bring you
closer to that goal:

• Go through all 25 bugs and try to recreate them.

• Sit down with the QA who found each bug to see a repro of that bug.

• Spend all the time you have this week trying to fix each bug.
