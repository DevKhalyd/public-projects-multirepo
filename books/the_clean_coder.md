Professionals speak truth to power. Professionals have the courage to say no to
their managers.

How do you say no to your boss? After all, it’s your boss! Aren’t you supposed to
do what your boss says?

No. Not if you are a professional.

Slaves are not allowed to say no. Laborers may be hesitant to say no. But
professionals are expected to say no. Indeed, good managers crave someone who
has the guts to say no. It’s the only way you can really get anything done.
