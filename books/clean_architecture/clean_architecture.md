# CHAPTER 1 - WHAT IS DESIGN AND ARCHITECTURE?

The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and
maintain the required system.

The measure of design quality is simply the measure of the effort required to
meet the needs of the customer. If that effort is low, and stays low throughout the
lifetime of the system, the design is good. If that effort grows with each new
release, the design is bad. Itâ€™s as simple as that.
