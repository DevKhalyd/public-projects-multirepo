# CHAPTER 1 - WHAT IS DESIGN AND ARCHITECTURE?

The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and
maintain the required system.

The measure of design quality is simply the measure of the effort required to
meet the needs of the customer. If that effort is low, and stays low throughout the
lifetime of the system, the design is good. If that effort grows with each new
release, the design is bad. It’s as simple as that.

To take software architecture seriously, you need to know what good software
architecture is. To build a system with a design and an architecture that minimize
effort and maximize productivity, you need to know which attributes of system
architecture lead to that end.


# CHAPTER 2 - A TALE OF TWO VALUES

Every software system provides two different values to the stakeholders:
behavior and structure. Software developers are responsible for ensuring that
both those values remain high. Unfortunately, they often focus on one to the
exclusion of the other. Even more unfortunately, they often focus on the lesser of
the two values, leaving the software system eventually valueless.

- Behavior: The first value of software is its behavior. Programmers are hired to make
machines behave in a way that makes or saves money for the stakeholders.

- Architecture: Software was invented to be “soft.” It was intended to be a way to easily change
the behavior of machines. If we’d wanted the behavior of machines to be hard to
change, we would have called it hardware.
