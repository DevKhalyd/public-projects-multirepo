# Overview

Vim  is a free and open-source, screen-based text editor program. It is an improved clone of Bill Joy's vi. Vim's author, Bram Moolenaar, derived Vim from a port of the Stevie editor for Amiga and released a version to the public in 1991. Vim is designed for use both from a command-line interface and as a standalone application in a graphical user interface. Since its release for the Amiga, cross-platform development has made it available on many other systems.

# Introduction

To get started with Vim, let’s discuss how you can get help. Vim has been around for a long time so there are several sources of help.

First of all, Vim ships with great documentation detailing its usage and commands. And best of all, you can quickly access all that information from Vim itself:

To access help you need to be in Command Mode (more on modes in the following sections). For now, type the ESC key followed by : (collon character), then use:

h -> Access the basic help

**To exit:** Esc + :q

# Vimtutor

Vim Tutor a.k.a. vimtutor is an interactive tutorial designed by the developers of Vim to help you get started with the basics of Vim.
