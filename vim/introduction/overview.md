# Introduction

To get started with Vim, let’s discuss how you can get help. Vim has been around for a long time so there are several sources of help.

First of all, Vim ships with great documentation detailing its usage and commands. And best of all, you can quickly access all that information from Vim itself:

To access help you need to be in Command Mode (more on modes in the following sections). For now, type the ESC key followed by : (collon character), then use:

h -> Access the basic help

**To exit:** Esc + :q

# Vimtutor

Vim Tutor a.k.a. vimtutor is an interactive tutorial designed by the developers of Vim to help you get started with the basics of Vim. Vim Tutor takes between 25 to 30 minutes to complete and after completing it you will be able to use Vim as a generic text editor by using the most common commands and keys to navigate and edit text.
