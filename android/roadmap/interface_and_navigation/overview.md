# Interface and Navigation

In Android development, the concepts of “Interface” and “Navigation” are crucial. The “Interface” often refers to the Graphical User Interface (GUI) that users interact with. This includes buttons, text fields, image views, scroll views and other UI elements that the users can interact with to perform certain tasks. Tools like XML and Material Designs are used for interface design in Android.

# Jetpack Compose

Jetpack Compose is a modern toolkit for building native Android UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs. Jetpack Compose offers a declarative approach to designing UI, where you can simply describe what your UI should look like at any given point of your app’s state, and Compose takes care of updating the view hierarchy, making UI development more efficient. It also integrates well with existing Android apps, letting you adopt its benefits at your own pace.

# App Shortcuts

App shortcuts in Android are designed to provide quick and convenient routes to specific actions or functions within your app from the device home screen. To use them, long-press an app’s icon and a pop-up menu will appear with the available shortcuts. Depending on the app, you might be able to send a message, make a booking, navigate home, or perform some other specific task without having to first open the app and navigate to the desired function. These shortcuts can also be moved and placed individually on the home screen for even faster access.

# Navigation Components

The Navigation Components are part of Android Jetpack and are designed to simplify the implementation of navigation in your Android app. These components help you follow best practices, handle deep linking, and provide a consistent user experience across deep and conditional navigation. They also automate many common tasks, such as handling Up and Back actions correctly across many different types of devices. The Navigation component consists of three key parts which are Navigation graph, NavHost, and NavController.
