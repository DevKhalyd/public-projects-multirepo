# Architecture and Design Patterns

Design Architecture refers to structuring the code in a way that increases its readability, maintainability, and testability. There are several ways to design architecture like Model-View-Controller (MVC), Model-View-Intent (MVI). Each of these define the interaction between the data, the logic, and the UI layers. Googleâ€™s recommended architectural pattern is Android Architecture Components which follow the principles of the MVVM pattern.

There are two types of patters:
