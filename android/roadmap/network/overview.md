# Network

In Android, the Network component offers vital capabilities that enable communication and interaction among users, between users and remote servers, and between users and cloud services. Android provides a variety of APIs and services to interact with networks. The primary APIs are the ConnectivityManager, WifiManager, TelephonyManager, and BluetoothManager APIs, among others. ConnectivityManager, for example, can tell you about network connectivity changes.

## Retrofit

Retrofit is a type-safe HTTP client for Android. It’s designed to connect your application with an API or a back-end web service. Retrofit uses annotations to encode details about the API’s operations and requests, such as the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD) and the query parameters. The main advantage of Retrofit over other similar libraries is in its simplicity and intuitiveness, and it efficiently handles all network calls.

## OkHttp

OkHttp is an HTTP client that’s extremely efficient, enabling several advanced features in Android app or other platforms that use Java. Developed by Square, it’s built for high efficiency and capacity, simplifying many networking tasks, including connection pooling, response caching, and request retries. OkHttp allows seamless recovery from network issues, minimizing the loss of data. The library ensures fewer errors and higher quality of service by using the modern TLS encryption, extensible request and response models, and a fluent API for ease of use and integration.

## Apollo-Android

Apollo Android is a set of tools for using GraphQL with Android, made by the Apollo community developers. It’s fully written in Kotlin and it was designed to seamlessly integrate with any Android app, making fetching data across network and handling data in the client-side a breeze. Apollo Android runs your queries and mutations and returns results as generated Kotlin types. It also normalizes your data and caches your results for further speed enhancements. It operates both on Android and Kotlin/JVM backend environment. It’s also coroutines-first making handling concurrency easy and effective. To use Apollo Android, you’ll set up the plugin, point it at your GraphQL schema, and write GraphQL queries.
