# App Components

**Activities:** These are individual screens that a user can interact with. Any UI action like touching a button or swiping a screen will usually take place within an activity.

**Services:** Unlike activities, services run in the background and don’t have a user interface. They’re used for repetitive or long running operations, like playing music or pulling in a feed of data from a server.

**Broadcast Receivers:** These are event listeners. The Android operating system uses them to respond to system-wide events.

**Content Providers:** They manage and share app data with other apps installed on the device. For security, data is not generally shared across apps.

**Intents:** These serve as messages or commands to the Android system. They’re used to signal to the Android system that certain events have occurred.
