# Linting

Linting in Android is a tool that analyzes the source code of your application to identify potential errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs. The term Linting came from a Unix utility that examined C language source code. In Android, it not only checks for potential Java issues but also for XML layout files and provides alerts for issues it encounters regarding usability, performance, and accessibility. For instance, it may scrutinize a draft of your AndroidManifest.xml file for potential duplication of elements or other anomalies that would cause the app to crash.

## Ktlint

ktlint is a static code analysis tool. It enforces a highly consistent style and adheres extensively to the official Kotlin coding conventions. ktlint does not have any configuration options (by design). The only exceptions are disabling specific rule(s) and specifying indentation size. ktlint can check, as well as automatically fix your code. Its main goal is to bring unified code style to your project. It works on the command line as well, so it can be hooked up into your continuous integration pipeline. It also has Ant, Gradle and Maven wrappers. You can use Ktlint on any Android/Kotlin project, as long as you have Gradle or Maven installed.

## Detekt

Detekt is a static code analysis tool for the Kotlin programming language. It operates on the abstract syntax tree provided by the Kotlin compiler and can run in the command line or as a task in your Gradle build script. Detekt provides complexity reports that can be used to identify overly complex code and help simplify it. It also checks for a variety of potential bugs and code smells, including issues with formatting, naming conventions, exception handling, and more. Moreover, Detekt is highly configurable, allowing you to enable, disable, or modify the behavior of its checks to suit your projectâ€™s needs.
