# Classes

Classes in Kotlin are declared using the keyword class:

```kt
class Person { /*...*/ }
```

# Constructors

A class in Kotlin has a primary constructor and possibly one or more secondary constructors. The primary constructor is declared in the class header, and it goes after the class name and optional type parameters.

```kt
class Person constructor(firstName: String) { /*...*/ }
```
