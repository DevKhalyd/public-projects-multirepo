# Demos

## Starting the Demo

“Thanks everyone for joining. I’m [Name], and today I’ll be walking you through [what you’re showing — e.g., the current version of our product / the new feature we’ve built / the technical flow behind X].”

“The goal of this demo is to [showcase the workflow / get your feedback / validate the integration / walk through the architecture].”

“Feel free to jump in with questions anytime — or we can also leave space at the end.”

## When Explaining Features or Components

“Let me start by giving a quick overview of the architecture.”

“Here’s the way we’ve structured it...”

“We chose this approach because it helps us [reduce latency / scale better / decouple the services / simplify the logic].”

“This component is responsible for...”

“We’re using [tech/tool] here because it [handles X efficiently / integrates well with Y].”

## When Showing Code or UI

“Here’s the main logic behind that feature.”

“As you can see, we’re handling the validation on the client side to avoid unnecessary requests.”

“This is the API response we get when the request is successful.”

“Let me trigger that real quick so you can see it in action.”

“We’ve added logging here to monitor any unexpected behaviors.”

## For Transitions

“Now that we’ve seen the frontend side, let’s jump into the backend.”

“Moving on to the next part...”

“Let’s switch gears and look at the integration.”

“Now, here’s where things get interesting...”

## For Wrapping Up

“That’s a quick tour of the current implementation.”

“In terms of next steps, we’re looking to [get your input / optimize X / finalize Y].”

“Happy to take any questions, feedback, or suggestions you might have.”

## Bonus: If Something Breaks or Doesn’t Work

“Let me just refresh — I might’ve broken the flow.”

“Looks like the service is still restarting. While that happens, I’ll explain what it’s supposed to do.”

“Good catch — that’s exactly the kind of feedback we need.”
