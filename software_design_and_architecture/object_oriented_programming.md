# Object Oriented Programming

## Model Driven Design

Model-driven design (MDD) is a software development methodology in which the design of a system is represented by a set of models, and the models are used to drive the development of the system. MDD is based on the idea that the design of a system can be represented by a set of models, and that these models can be used to generate the code for the system.

The main advantage of using MDD is that it allows for a clear separation of concerns between the design and implementation of a system. The models represent the design of the system, and the code is generated from the models, which makes it easier to maintain and evolve the system. Additionally, MDD can also improve the quality of the code, as the models can be used to check for design errors and inconsistencies before the code is generated.

## Paradigm Features

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of “objects,” which are instances of a class. OOP has several key features that distinguish it from other programming paradigms:

Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Abstraction
Classes
Objects
Interfaces
Dynamic binding
Message passing

# Primary Principles

Encapsulation: The practice of wrapping an object’s internal data and behavior within a defined interface, and hiding the implementation details from the outside world.

Inheritance: The ability of a new class to inherit the properties and methods of an existing class, enabling code reuse and allowing for a hierarchical organization of classes.

Polymorphism: The ability of objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common parent class, allowing code to be written in a more general and flexible way.

Abstraction: The process of hiding the implementation details of an object and exposing only its essential features, reducing complexity and improving the modularity of the code.

Classes: The blueprint for creating objects, which have both data (attributes) and behavior (methods).

Objects: Instances of a class, which have their own unique state and behavior.
