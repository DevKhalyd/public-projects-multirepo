# Enterprise Patterns

Enterprise patterns are a set of design patterns that are commonly used in the development of enterprise software applications. These patterns provide a common vocabulary and a set of best practices for solving common problems that arise in the development of large, complex software systems. Some examples of enterprise patterns include:

Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
Model-View-Controller (MVC)
Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)
Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
Event Sourcing
Microservices
Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
These patterns can help to improve the maintainability and scalability of the software, by providing a clear separation of concerns and allowing for a more modular and flexible architecture.

## DTOs

The Data Transfer Object Design Pattern is one of the enterprise application architecture patterns that calls for the use of objects that aggregate and encapsulate data for transfer. A Data Transfer Object is, essentially, like a data structure. It should not contain any business logic but should contain serialization and deserialization mechanisms.

## Identity Maps

Identity Maps is a pattern used in enterprise application development to maintain a map of objects that have been loaded from the database, keyed by their unique identifier. It is used to ensure that multiple copies of the same object are not created in memory when the same data is accessed multiple times.

The identity map pattern is typically used in conjunction with an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool. When an object is loaded from the database, it is first checked against the identity map to see if it has already been loaded. If it has, the existing object is returned, instead of creating a new copy.

## Use Cases

Use Cases are a pattern used in enterprise application development to represent the functional requirements of a system. They describe the interactions between the system and its users, and the steps that are required to accomplish a specific goal. Use cases are a way to capture the requirements of the system in a way that is easily understood by both the development team and the stakeholders.

A use case is a description of a sequence of actions that a system performs in response to a request from a user, in order to achieve a specific goal. A use case typically includes:

- The actor (user) who initiates the action
- The goal that the actor wants to achieve
- The steps required to achieve the goal, including any alternative paths or error conditions
- The expected outcome of the interaction

Use cases are often used to drive the design and development of the system, as they provide a clear and detailed understanding of the requirements.

## Repositories

Repositories are a pattern used in enterprise application development to provide a consistent and abstracted way to access data storage. Repositories act as an abstraction layer between the application and the data storage, providing a consistent and simple API for data access and manipulation.

A repository is a pattern that can be used to organize the data access code and encapsulate the logic of retrieving and storing objects. Repositories provide a way to separate the concerns of the data access from the rest of the application, allowing the application code to be written against an interface and not a specific data storage technology.
