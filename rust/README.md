# Basic Commands

```bash
# Compile
$ rustc ${name-file}.rs
# Run 
$ ./main

# Note: Use cargo instead
```


**cargo fmt:** Running this command reformats all the Rust code in the current crate. This should only change the code style, not the code semantics.

**cargo fix:** The rustfix tool is included with Rust installations and can automatically fix compiler warnings that have a clear way to correct the problem that’s likely what you want. It’s likely you’ve seen compiler warnings before.

**cargo clippy:** The Clippy tool is a collection of lints to analyze your code so you can catch common mistakes and improve your Rust code.
