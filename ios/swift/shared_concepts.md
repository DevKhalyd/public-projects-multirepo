# Collection Types

Swift provides three primary collection types, known as arrays, sets, and dictionaries, for storing collections of values. Arrays are ordered collections of values. Sets are unordered collections of unique values. Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value associations.

# Control Tranfer Statements

Control transfer statements change the order in which your code is executed, by transferring control from one piece of code to another. Swift has five control transfer statements:

- continue

- break

- fallthrough

- return

- throw


# Fallthrough

In Swift, switch statements don't fall through the bottom of each case and into the next one. That is, the entire switch statement completes its execution as soon as the first matching case is completed. By contrast, C requires you to insert an explicit break statement at the end of every switch case to prevent fallthrough. Avoiding default fallthrough means that Swift switch statements are much more concise and predictable than their counterparts in C, and thus they avoid executing multiple switch cases by mistake.

If you need C-style fallthrough behavior, you can opt in to this behavior on a case-by-case basis with the fallthrough keyword. The example below uses fallthrough to create a textual description of a number.

```swift
let integerToDescribe = 5
var description = "The number \(integerToDescribe) is"
switch integerToDescribe {
case 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19:
    description += " a prime number, and also"
    fallthrough
default:
    description += " an integer."
}
print(description)
// Prints "The number 5 is a prime number, and also an integer."
```

# Labeled Statements

In Swift, you can nest loops and conditional statements inside other loops and conditional statements to create complex control flow structures. However, loops and conditional statements can both use the break statement to end their execution prematurely. Therefore, it’s sometimes useful to be explicit about which loop or conditional statement you want a break statement to terminate. Similarly, if you have multiple nested loops, it can be useful to be explicit about which loop the continue statement should affect.

To achieve these aims, you can mark a loop statement or conditional statement with a statement label. With a conditional statement, you can use a statement label with the break statement to end the execution of the labeled statement. With a loop statement, you can use a statement label with the break or continue statement to end or continue the execution of the labeled statement.

A labeled statement is indicated by placing a label on the same line as the statement’s introducer keyword, followed by a colon. Here’s an example of this syntax for a while loop, although the principle is the same for all loops and switch statements:


```swift
<#label name#>: while <#condition#> {
   <#statements#>
}
```

Example:

```swift
gameLoop: while square != finalSquare {
    diceRoll += 1
    if diceRoll == 7 { diceRoll = 1 }
    switch square + diceRoll {
    case finalSquare:
        // diceRoll will move us to the final square, so the game is over
        break gameLoop
    case let newSquare where newSquare > finalSquare:
        // diceRoll will move us beyond the final square, so roll again
        continue gameLoop
    default:
        // this is a valid move, so find out its effect
        square += diceRoll
        square += board[square]
    }
}
print("Game over!")
```

# Early Exit

A guard statement, like an if statement, executes statements depending on the Boolean value of an expression. You use a guard statement to require that a condition must be true in order for the code after the guard statement to be executed. Unlike an if statement, a guard statement always has an else clause — the code inside the else clause is executed if the condition isn’t true.

Example:

```swift
func greet(person: [String: String]) {
    guard let name = person["name"] else {
        return
    }


    print("Hello \(name)!")


    guard let location = person["location"] else {
        print("I hope the weather is nice near you.")
        return
    }


    print("I hope the weather is nice in \(location).")
}


greet(person: ["name": "John"])
// Prints "Hello John!"
// Prints "I hope the weather is nice near you."
greet(person: ["name": "Jane", "location": "Cupertino"])
// Prints "Hello Jane!"
// Prints "I hope the weather is nice in Cupertino."
```

# Deferred Actions

Unlike control-flow constructs like if and while, which let you control whether part of your code is executed or how many times it gets executed, defer controls when a piece of code is executed. You use a defer block to write code that will be executed later, when your program reaches the end of the current scope. For example:

```swift
var score = 1
if score < 10 {
    defer {
        print(score)
    }
    score += 5
}
// Prints "6"
```

The code inside of the defer always runs, regardless of how the program exits that scope. That includes code like an early exit from a function, breaking out of a for loop, or throwing an error. This behavior makes defer useful for operations where you need to guarantee a pair of actions happen — like manually allocating and freeing memory, opening and closing low-level file descriptors, and beginning and ending transactions in a database — because you can write both actions next to each other in your code. For example, the following code gives a temporary bonus to the score, by adding and subtracting 100 inside a chunk of code:

```swift
var score = 3
if score < 100 {
    score += 100
    defer {
        score -= 100
    }
    // Other code that uses the score with its bonus goes here.
    print(score)
}
// Prints "103"
```

If you write more than one defer block in the same scope, the first one you specify is the last one to run. For example:

```swift
if score < 10 {
    defer {
        print(score)
    }
    defer {
        print("The score is:")
    }
    score += 5
}
// Prints "The score is:"
// Prints "6"
```

If your program stops running — for example, because of a runtime error or a crash — deferred code doesn’t execute. However, deferred code does execute after an error is thrown; for information about using defer with error handling, see Specifying Cleanup Actions.

# Checking API Availability

Swift has built-in support for checking API availability, which ensures that you don’t accidentally use APIs that are unavailable on a given deployment target.

The compiler uses availability information in the SDK to verify that all of the APIs used in your code are available on the deployment target specified by your project. Swift reports an error at compile time if you try to use an API that isn’t available. Example:

```swift
if #available(iOS 10, macOS 10.12, *) {
    // Use iOS 10 APIs on iOS, and use macOS 10.12 APIs on macOS
} else {
    // Fall back to earlier iOS and macOS APIs
}

// or

// They do the same thing
if #available(iOS 10, *) {
} else {
    // Fallback code
}


if #unavailable(iOS 10) {
    // Fallback code
}

```



# Functions

Example:

```swift
func greet(person: String) -> String {
    let greeting = "Hello, " + person + "!"
    return greeting
}
print(greet(person: "Anna"))
// Prints "Hello, Anna!"
print(greet(person: "Brian"))
// Prints "Hello, Brian!"
```

# Functions With an Implicit Return

If the entire body of the function is a single expression, the function implicitly returns that expression. For example, both functions below have the same behavior:

```swift
func greeting(for person: String) -> String {
    "Hello, " + person + "!"
}
print(greeting(for: "Dave"))
// Prints "Hello, Dave!"


func anotherGreeting(for person: String) -> String {
    return "Hello, " + person + "!"
}
print(anotherGreeting(for: "Dave"))
// Prints "Hello, Dave!"
```

# Specifying Argument Labels

You write an argument label before the parameter name, separated by a space:

```swift
func someFunction(argumentLabel parameterName: Int) {
    // In the function body, parameterName refers to the argument value
    // for that parameter.
}
```

Here’s a variation of the greet(person:) function that takes a person’s name and hometown and returns a greeting:

```swift
func greet(person: String, from hometown: String) -> String {
    return "Hello \(person)!  Glad you could visit from \(hometown)."
}
print(greet(person: "Bill", from: "Cupertino"))
// Prints "Hello Bill!  Glad you could visit from Cupertino."
```

The use of argument labels can allow a function to be called in an expressive, sentence-like manner, while still providing a function body that’s readable and clear in intent.

# Omitting Arguments Labels

If you don’t want an argument label for a parameter, write an underscore (_) instead of an explicit argument label for that parameter.

```swift
func someFunction(_ firstParameterName: Int, secondParameterName: Int) {
    // In the function body, firstParameterName and secondParameterName
    // refer to the argument values for the first and second parameters.
}
someFunction(1, secondParameterName: 2)
```

If a parameter has an argument label, the argument must be labeled when you call the function.

# Variadic Parameters

A variadic parameter accepts zero or more values of a specified type. You use a variadic parameter to specify that the parameter can be passed a varying number of input values when the function is called. Write variadic parameters by inserting three period characters (...) after the parameter’s type name.

The values passed to a variadic parameter are made available within the function’s body as an array of the appropriate type. For example, a variadic parameter with a name of numbers and a type of Double... is made available within the function’s body as a constant array called numbers of type [Double].

The example below calculates the arithmetic mean (also known as the average) for a list of numbers of any length:

```swift
func arithmeticMean(_ numbers: Double...) -> Double {
    var total: Double = 0
    for number in numbers {
        total += number
    }
    return total / Double(numbers.count)
}
arithmeticMean(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
// returns 3.0, which is the arithmetic mean of these five numbers
arithmeticMean(3, 8.25, 18.75)
// returns 10.0, which is the arithmetic mean of these three numbers
```

A function can have multiple variadic parameters. The first parameter that comes after a variadic parameter must have an argument label. The argument label makes it unambiguous which arguments are passed to the variadic parameter and which arguments are passed to the parameters that come after the variadic parameter.


# In-Out Parameters

Function parameters are constants by default. Trying to change the value of a function parameter from within the body of that function results in a compile-time error. This means that you can’t change the value of a parameter by mistake. If you want a function to modify a parameter’s value, and you want those changes to persist after the function call has ended, define that parameter as an in-out parameter instead.

You write an in-out parameter by placing the inout keyword right before a parameter’s type. An in-out parameter has a value that’s passed in to the function, is modified by the function, and is passed back out of the function to replace the original value. For a detailed discussion of the behavior of in-out parameters and associated compiler optimizations, see In-Out Parameters.

You can only pass a variable as the argument for an in-out parameter. You can’t pass a constant or a literal value as the argument, because constants and literals can’t be modified. You place an ampersand (&) directly before a variable’s name when you pass it as an argument to an in-out parameter, to indicate that it can be modified by the function.

Example:

```swift
func swapTwoInts(_ a: inout Int, _ b: inout Int) {
    let temporaryA = a
    a = b
    b = temporaryA
}


var someInt = 3
var anotherInt = 107
swapTwoInts(&someInt, &anotherInt)
print("someInt is now \(someInt), and anotherInt is now \(anotherInt)")
// Prints "someInt is now 107, and anotherInt is now 3"
```

The example above shows that the original values of someInt and anotherInt are modified by the swapTwoInts(_:_:) function, even though they were originally defined outside of the function.

In-out parameters aren’t the same as returning a value from a function. The swapTwoInts example above doesn’t define a return type or return a value, but it still modifies the values of someInt and anotherInt. In-out parameters are an alternative way for a function to have an effect outside of the scope of its function body.
