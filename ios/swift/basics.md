# Constants and Variables

Constants and variables associate a name (such as maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts or welcomeMessage) with a value of a particular type (such as the number 10 or the string "Hello"). The value of a constant can‚Äôt be changed once it‚Äôs set, whereas a variable can be set to a different value in the future.

Constants and variables must be declared before they‚Äôre used. You declare constants with the let keyword and variables with the var keyword. Here‚Äôs an example of how constants and variables can be used to track the number of login attempts a user has made:


```swift
// Constants
let maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts = 10
// Variables
var currentLoginAttempt = 0
```

You can declare multiple constants or multiple variables on a single line, separated by commas:

```swift
var x = 0.0, y = 0.0, z = 0.0
```

# Type Annotations

You can provide a type annotation when you declare a constant or variable, to be clear about the kind of values the constant or variable can store. Write a type annotation by placing a colon after the constant or variable name, followed by a space, followed by the name of the type to use.

This example provides a type annotation for a variable called welcomeMessage, to indicate that the variable can store String values:

```swift
var welcomeMessage: String
welcomeMessage = "Hello"
```

# Naming Constants and Variables

Constant and variable names can contain almost any character, including Unicode characters:

```swift
let œÄ = 3.14159
let ‰Ω†Â•Ω = "‰Ω†Â•Ω‰∏ñÁïå"
let üê∂üêÆ = "dogcow"
```
Constant and variable names can‚Äôt contain whitespace characters, mathematical symbols, arrows, private-use Unicode scalar values, or line- and box-drawing characters. Nor can they begin with a number, although numbers may be included elsewhere within the name.

## Note

If you need to give a constant or variable the same name as a reserved Swift keyword, surround the keyword with backticks (`) when using it as a name. However, avoid using keywords as names unless you have absolutely no choice.

# Printing Constants and Variables

You can print the current value of a constant or variable with the print(_:separator:terminator:) function:

```swift
print(welcomeMessage)
// Prints "Hello"
print("The current value of welcomeMessage is \(welcomeMessage)")
```

# Comments

Use comments to include nonexecutable text in your code, as a note or reminder to yourself. Comments are ignored by the Swift compiler when your code is compiled.

```swift
// This is a comment.
/* This is also a comment
but is written over multiple lines. */
```

# Semicolons

Unlike many other languages, Swift doesn‚Äôt require you to write a semicolon (;) after each statement in your code, although you can do so if you wish. However, semicolons are required if you want to write multiple separate statements on a single line:

```swift
let cat = "üê±"; print(cat
```

# Integers

Integers are whole numbers with no fractional component, such as 42 and -23. Integers are either signed (positive, zero, or negative) or unsigned (positive or zero).

Swift provides signed and unsigned integers in 8, 16, 32, and 64-bit forms. These integers follow a naming convention similar to C, in that an 8-bit unsigned integer is of type UInt8, and a 32-bit signed integer is of type Int32. Like all types in Swift, these integer types have capitalized names.

# Integer Bounds

You can access the minimum and maximum values of each integer type with its min and max properties:

```swift
let minValue = UInt8.min // minValue is equal to 0, and is of type UInt8
let maxValue = UInt8.max // maxValue is equal to 255, and is of type UInt8
```

# Int

In most cases, you don‚Äôt need to pick a specific size of integer to use in your code. Swift provides an additional integer type, Int, which has the same size as the current platform‚Äôs native word size:

On a 32-bit platform, Int is the same size as Int32.

On a 64-bit platform, Int is the same size as Int64.

Unless you need to work with a specific size of integer, always use Int for integer values in your code. This aids code consistency and interoperability. Even on 32-bit platforms, Int can store any value between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647, and is large enough for many integer ranges.

# Floating-Point Numbers

Double represents a 64-bit floating-point number.

Float represents a 32-bit floating-point number.

Note

Double has a precision of at least 15 decimal digits, whereas the precision of Float can be as little as 6 decimal digits. The appropriate floating-point type to use depends on the nature and range of values you need to work with in your code. In situations where either type would be appropriate, Double is preferred.


# Numeric Literals

Integer literals can be written as:

A decimal number, with no prefix

A binary number, with a 0b prefix

An octal number, with a 0o prefix

A hexadecimal number, with a 0x prefix

All of these integer literals have a decimal value of 17:

```swift
let decimalInteger = 17
let binaryInteger = 0b10001       // 17 in binary notation
let octalInteger = 0o21           // 17 in octal notation
let hexadecimalInteger = 0x11     // 17 in hexadecimal notation
```

# Type Aliases

Type aliases define an alternative name for an existing type. You define type aliases with the typealias keyword.

Type aliases are useful when you want to refer to an existing type by a name that is contextually more appropriate, such as when working with data of a specific size from an external source:

```swift
typealias AudioSample = UInt16
var maxAmplitudeFound = AudioSample.min
```

# Tuples

Tuples group multiple values into a single compound value. The values within a tuple can be of any type and don‚Äôt have to be of the same type as each other.

```swift
let http404Error = (404, "Not Found")
// http404Error is of type (Int, String), and equals (404, "Not Found")

let (statusCode, statusMessage) = http404Error
print("The status code is \(statusCode)")
// Prints "The status code is 404"
print("The status message is \(statusMessage)")
// Prints "The status message is Not Found"
```


# Optionals

You use optionals in situations where a value may be absent. An optional represents two possibilities: Either there is a value, and you can unwrap the optional to access that value, or there isn‚Äôt a value at all.

```swift
let possibleNumber = "123"
let convertedNumber = Int(possibleNumber)
// convertedNumber is inferred to be of type "Int?", or "optional Int"
```

# Nil

You set an optional variable to a valueless state by assigning it the special value nil:

```swift
var serverResponseCode: Int? = 404
// serverResponseCode contains an actual Int value of 404
serverResponseCode = nil
// serverResponseCode now contains no value
```

# Optional Binding

You use optional binding to find out whether an optional contains a value, and if so, to make that value available as a temporary constant or variable. Optional binding can be used with if, guard, and while statements to check for a value inside an optional, and to extract that value into a constant or variable, as part of a single action.


```swift
if let actualNumber = Int(possibleNumber) {
    print("The string \"\(possibleNumber)\" has an integer value of \(actualNumber)")
} else {
    print("The string \"\(possibleNumber)\" couldn't be converted to an integer")
}
```

If you don‚Äôt need to refer to the original, optional constant or variable after accessing the value it contains, you can use the same name for the new constant or variable:

```swift
let myNumber = Int(possibleNumber)
// Here, myNumber is an optional integer
if let myNumber = myNumber {
    // Here, myNumber is a non-optional integer
    print("My number is \(myNumber)")
}
// Prints "My number is 123"
```

Because this kind of code is so common, you can use a shorter spelling to unwrap an optional value: Write just the name of the constant or variable that you‚Äôre unwrapping. The new, unwrapped constant or variable implicitly uses the same name as the optional value.

```swift
if let myNumber {
    print("My number is \(myNumber)")
}
// Prints "My number is 123"
```

# Providing a Fallback Value

Another way to handle a missing value is to supply a default value using the nil-coalescing operator (??). If the optional on the left of the ?? isn‚Äôt nil, that value is unwrapped and used. Otherwise, the value on the right of ?? is used. For example, the code below greets someone by name if one is specified, and uses a generic greeting when the name is nil.

```swift
let name: String? = nil
let greeting = "Hello, " + (name ?? "friend") + "!"
print(greeting)
// Prints "Hello, friend!"
```

# Force Unwrapping

When nil represents an unrecoverable failure, such as a programmer error or corrupted state, you can access the underlying value by adding an exclamation mark (!) to the end of the optional‚Äôs name. This is known as force unwrapping the optional‚Äôs value. When you force unwrap a non-nil value, the result is its unwrapped value. Force unwrapping a nil value triggers a runtime error.

```swift
let possibleNumber = "123"
let convertedNumber = Int(possibleNumber)


let number = convertedNumber!


guard let number = convertedNumber else {
    fatalError("The number was invalid")
}
```

Both versions of the code above depend on convertedNumber always containing a value. Writing that requirement as part of the code, using either of the approaches above, lets your code check that the requirement is true at runtime.
