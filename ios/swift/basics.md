# Constants and Variables

Constants and variables associate a name (such as maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts or welcomeMessage) with a value of a particular type (such as the number 10 or the string "Hello"). The value of a constant can‚Äôt be changed once it‚Äôs set, whereas a variable can be set to a different value in the future.

Constants and variables must be declared before they‚Äôre used. You declare constants with the let keyword and variables with the var keyword. Here‚Äôs an example of how constants and variables can be used to track the number of login attempts a user has made:


```swift
// Constants
let maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts = 10
// Variables
var currentLoginAttempt = 0
```

You can declare multiple constants or multiple variables on a single line, separated by commas:

```swift
var x = 0.0, y = 0.0, z = 0.0
```

# Type Annotations

You can provide a type annotation when you declare a constant or variable, to be clear about the kind of values the constant or variable can store. Write a type annotation by placing a colon after the constant or variable name, followed by a space, followed by the name of the type to use.

This example provides a type annotation for a variable called welcomeMessage, to indicate that the variable can store String values:

```swift
var welcomeMessage: String
welcomeMessage = "Hello"
```

# Naming Constants and Variables

Constant and variable names can contain almost any character, including Unicode characters:

```swift
let œÄ = 3.14159
let ‰Ω†Â•Ω = "‰Ω†Â•Ω‰∏ñÁïå"
let üê∂üêÆ = "dogcow"
```
Constant and variable names can‚Äôt contain whitespace characters, mathematical symbols, arrows, private-use Unicode scalar values, or line- and box-drawing characters. Nor can they begin with a number, although numbers may be included elsewhere within the name.

## Note

If you need to give a constant or variable the same name as a reserved Swift keyword, surround the keyword with backticks (`) when using it as a name. However, avoid using keywords as names unless you have absolutely no choice.
