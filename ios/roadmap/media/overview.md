# Media Overview

The iOS Media Layer is a collection of frameworks and technologies that enable developers to incorporate rich multimedia experiences into their apps. It includes tools for handling audio, video, and graphics. Key components are AVFoundation for working with time-based audiovisual media, Core Audio for low-level audio processing, Core Animation for fluid animations and visual effects, and Metal for high-performance graphics rendering. This layer also provides support for camera operations, audio recording, and media playback.

# Core Graphics

Core Graphics, also known as Quartz, is a powerful 2D graphics rendering framework in iOS. It provides essential functions for drawing shapes, images, and text, handling low-level graphic operations with precision and efficiency. Core Graphics supports advanced features like color management, path-based drawing, and anti-aliasing, enabling developers to create detailed and visually appealing graphics within their applications.
