# Media Overview

The iOS Media Layer is a collection of frameworks and technologies that enable developers to incorporate rich multimedia experiences into their apps. It includes tools for handling audio, video, and graphics. Key components are AVFoundation for working with time-based audiovisual media, Core Audio for low-level audio processing, Core Animation for fluid animations and visual effects, and Metal for high-performance graphics rendering. This layer also provides support for camera operations, audio recording, and media playback.

# Core Graphics

Core Graphics, also known as Quartz, is a powerful 2D graphics rendering framework in iOS. It provides essential functions for drawing shapes, images, and text, handling low-level graphic operations with precision and efficiency. Core Graphics supports advanced features like color management, path-based drawing, and anti-aliasing, enabling developers to create detailed and visually appealing graphics within their applications.

# Core Animation

Core Animation is a powerful framework in iOS that allows developers to create rich and interactive animations. It works by compositing layers, each representing a view, and uses hardware acceleration to ensure smooth animations. Core Animation simplifies the process of animating properties such as position, scale, and opacity, providing implicit and explicit animation techniques. It enhances the user interface experience by enabling complex visual effects, transitions, and animations with minimal impact on performance, making it essential for crafting visually appealing iOS applications.
