# Dependency Manager

Dependency managers in iOS development are tools that automate the process of adding, updating, and managing third-party libraries and frameworks in Swift and Objective-C projects. These tools simplify the integration of external code, ensuring version compatibility and reducing manual setup errors. The most popular dependency managers for iOS are CocoaPods, Carthage, and Swift Package Manager (SPM). CocoaPods, the oldest and most widely used, integrates directly with Xcode projects and offers a vast library of pods. Carthage provides a more decentralized approach, building frameworks separately from the main project. Swift Package Manager, integrated into Xcode, is Apple’s official solution, offering seamless integration with Swift projects. Each manager has its strengths, with developers choosing based on project needs, team preferences, and specific library support. Effective use of dependency managers streamlines development workflows, promotes code reuse, and helps maintain up-to-date, efficient codebases in iOS applications.

# Swift Package Manager

The Swift Package Manager (SwiftPM) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. It’s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies. The Package Manager is included in Swift 3.0 and above.

# CocoaPods

CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. It has over 100 thousand libraries and is used in over 3 million apps. CocoaPods can help you scale your projects elegantly.

# Carthage

Carthage is a decentralized dependency manager for iOS and macOS development, offering a lightweight alternative to CocoaPods. It focuses on building frameworks rather than integrating directly into projects, giving developers more control over their project structure. Carthage fetches and builds dependencies as specified in a Cartfile, creating standalone frameworks that can be easily integrated into Xcode projects. This approach keeps the project’s structure intact and allows for easier version control. Carthage supports both Swift and Objective-C libraries and works well with dynamic frameworks. It’s particularly favored for its simplicity and non-invasive nature, as it doesn’t modify project files or create workspaces. While Carthage requires manual framework linking, which can be more time-consuming initially, it offers faster build times and more flexibility in managing dependencies. This tool is often preferred by developers who desire more control over their dependency integration process and project structure.

# Which One Should You Use?

New Swift Projects? → Swift Package Manager (SPM)

Complex projects with many dependencies? → CocoaPods

Manual control over frameworks? → Carthage

Since Apple is pushing SPM as the default, it's a great choice if your dependencies support it. Otherwise, CocoaPods is still widely used, and Carthage is useful for specific cases.
