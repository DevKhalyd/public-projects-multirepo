# Combine

Combine is Apple’s built-in framework for reactive programming, using the same publisher-subscriber pattern as most modern approaches to this issue. Combine introduces the concept of a Cancellable (i.e. a subscription) and many different operators to use on these Cancellables. When writing Combine code, developers will notice complex generic types. For this reason, type-erasure can be done through AnyCancellable.

# Publishers / Subscribers

The Combine framework in iOS uses Publishers and Subscribers as core components for reactive programming. Publishers are types that can emit a sequence of values over time, representing sources of asynchronous events or data. Subscribers receive and process these values, defining how to handle the published data. Publishers can emit multiple values, complete successfully, or terminate with an error. Subscribers can receive and react to these events, often updating UI or triggering further operations.

# Operators & Pipelines

The Combine framework uses operators and pipelines to process and transform data streams. Operators are methods that perform operations on publishers, such as filtering, mapping, or combining data. Pipelines are chains of these operators that process data from its source to its final destination. Common operators include map, filter, reduce, and merge. Pipelines allow developers to declaratively describe complex asynchronous operations, handling tasks like data transformation, error management, and combining multiple data sources. This approach simplifies handling of asynchronous events and state changes, enabling more robust and maintainable code in iOS applications.

# Combine and MVVM

Combine and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) form a powerful combination in iOS development. Combine’s reactive approach complements MVVM’s separation of concerns. In this pairing, ViewModels use Combine publishers to expose data streams to Views, which subscribe to these streams for reactive UI updates. Models can publish changes through Combine, which ViewModels then process and transform. This setup allows for clean, declarative bindings between Views and ViewModels, reducing boilerplate code and improving testability. Combine’s operators facilitate complex data transformations within ViewModels, while its handling of asynchronous operations simplifies tasks like network requests.
