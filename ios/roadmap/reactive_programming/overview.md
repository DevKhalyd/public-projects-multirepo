# Reactive Programming

Reactive Programming is a declarative programming paradigm focused on data streams and the propagation of change. It emphasizes the automatic distribution of changes through data flows. Key concepts include observable streams of data, operators to transform and combine streams, and subscribers that react to stream changes. This approach allows for handling asynchronous data flows, managing complex event sequences, and building responsive user interfaces. In iOS development, frameworks like Combine (Appleâ€™s native solution) and RxSwift implement reactive principles.
