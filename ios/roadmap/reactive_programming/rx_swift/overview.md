# RxSwift

RxSwift is a reactive programming library for iOS development, implementing ReactiveX (Rx) principles in Swift. It provides a framework for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences. RxSwift facilitates the handling of asynchronous data streams, simplifying tasks like network requests, user interface events, and data binding. It offers a rich set of operators for transforming, combining, and filtering data streams. The library promotes a declarative programming style, reducing complexities in managing state and dependencies. While similar to Appleâ€™s Combine framework, RxSwift has broader platform support and a larger ecosystem.
