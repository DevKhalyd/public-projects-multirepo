# Accessibility

With built-in accessibility features, accessibility APIs, and developer tools, Apple operating systems provide extraordinary opportunities to deliver high-quality experiences to everyone, including people with disabilities. Take advantage of VoiceOver — the revolutionary screen reader for blind and low-vision users — Music Haptics, Switch Control, Guided Access, Text to Speech, closed‑captioned or audio‑described video, and more.

# Dynamic Type

The Dynamic Type feature allows users to choose the size of textual content displayed on the screen. It helps users who need larger text for better readability. It also accomodates those who can read smaller text, allowing more information to appear on the screen. Apps that support Dynamic Type also provide a more consistent reading experience.

# Voice Over

VoiceOver is an assistive technology that enables people to experience the interface on their devices without having to see the screen. People who are blind or have low vision depend on VoiceOver to provide auditory feedback while using their devices, but VoiceOver can be useful to people in a wide variety of contexts. For example, someone prone to motion sickness might choose to turn VoiceOver on while they’re in a moving vehicle.

VoiceOver is a screen reader that enables people to experience an app’s interface without having to see the screen. With touch gestures on iOS and iPadOS, keyboard buttons on macOS, and remote buttons on tvOS, VoiceOver users can move through your app’s UI in reading order, from the top of the screen to the bottom, and receive descriptions in over 60 languages and locales of UI controls, text, and images audibly or in braille.

# Accesibility Inspector

The Accessibility Inspector is a powerful tool in Xcode that helps developers ensure their iOS applications are accessible to users with disabilities. It provides a comprehensive view of an app’s accessibility features, allowing developers to inspect and test various accessibility attributes of UI elements. The inspector displays information such as accessibility labels, hints, and traits for each element on the screen. It enables real-time simulation of different accessibility settings, such as VoiceOver, to test how the app behaves under various accessibility conditions. Developers can use the Accessibility Inspector to identify and fix issues related to screen reader compatibility, color contrast, and touch target sizes. This tool is crucial for creating inclusive apps that comply with accessibility guidelines and standards, ensuring that apps are usable by people with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments. Regular use of the Accessibility Inspector throughout the development process helps in building more universally accessible and user-friendly iOS applications.
