# TCA 

The Composable Architecture (TCA) is a library and architectural pattern for building iOS applications, developed by Point-Free. It emphasizes:

**State management:** All app state is centralized and clearly defined.

**Composability:** Complex features are built from smaller, reusable components.

**Side effect management:** Effects like network calls are handled predictably and testably.

**Testing:** The architecture facilitates comprehensive unit and integration testing.

TCA uses a unidirectional data flow, where state changes trigger actions, which may produce effects and lead to new states. It relies on Swiftâ€™s value types and function composition to create a predictable and maintainable app structure.
